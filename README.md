This is the the front end of an ever evolving twitterish app built with react and redux. 

The site is [here](https://postioo.herokuapp.com). Sometimes takes a second to wake up on that free heroku plan. Maybe I should ping it every so often.

Still to come: ui animations, more views, further design, refactoring, other stuff!

## The state
The state is instantiated from json in src/data/initialState.json and looks like:

```
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "id": "f9005b4e-975e-433d-a646-79df172e1dbb",
      "postId": "home",
      "user": "conortripler",
      "avatar": "connor.jpg",
      "text": "*sits 27 hours for an oil on canvas portrait* omg delete that. Bartholomew im serious do not fucking hang that in the Great Hall",
      "rating": 0,
      "timestamp": "Fri Mar 11 2016 12:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST)",
      "link": "https://twitter.com/conortripler/status/671106116768555008"
    },
    {
      "id": "f9005b4e-975e-433d-a646-79df172e1dbb4c",
      "postId": "f9005b4e-975e-433d-a646-79df172e1dbb",
      "user": "egg rando",
      "avatar": "egg-yellow.png",
      "text": "just like a damn selfer lol",
      "rating": 0,
      "timestamp": "Fri Mar 11 2016 12:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST)"
    },
    ...
    ], 
  "user": {
    "name": "admin",
    "avatar": "admin.jpg"
  }
}
```

All posts and comments are in the posts arrayâ€”which allows us to use the same components, actions, and reducers for both. Eg the feed on the home view is the same component (src/components/ui/Feed.js) as the comments on a single post view.

Posts and comments are differentiated by their postId: if the postId is "home" then it's a post that will appear on the home page. If the postID is an id of another post then it will be rendered as a comment of that post.

## The components
Components are pretty well commented. If you want to take a look the app lives at src/index.js. The next step would be to check out src/components/App.js. Then you could look at all the redux stuff in src/store/storeFactory.js, src/store/reducers.js, src/actions.js, src/components/containers.js. Then all the stateless react components are in src/components/ui

## What I want to do next
First I really need to refactor the css. You can check out my thoughts on the topic in src/styles/styles.css. Things got out of hand. Please don't judge me.

I'd like to have state persist in local storage.

Maybe I'll build the backend some day and turn it into a real app. Please do not steal my billion dollar idea. Thank you.
